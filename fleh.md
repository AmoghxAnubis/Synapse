📂 Synapse Landing Page: "The Problem vs. Solution" Comparison SectionTarget AI Engine: Google Antigravity (Planning Mode)Architecture: Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons, Framer MotionDesign Aesthetic: "Evalis-Inspired" (Dark mode, high contrast, glassmorphism panels, glowing accents for the "winning" column).Objective: Add a new section to the single-page landing page that visually contrasts existing disjointed solutions (Cloud AI, standard OS search) with Synapse's unified, local-first approach.1. Section Overview & PlacementPlacement: This section should live on the main landing page (app/page.tsx), likely scroll-linked after the initial "Hero" or "Features" section, and before the final "Interactive Footer."Goal: Persuade the user that their current workflow is broken due to context switching and lack of privacy, and prove Synapse is the superior architecture.2. Visual & Behavioral GuidelinesWe will avoid a traditional, boring table with heavy borders. Instead, we will use two large, distinct glassmorphic panels side-by-side.The "Competitor" Panel (Left - "Fragmented Status Quo"):Visuals: Slightly dimmer background (bg-zinc-900/30), subtle gray borders. The vibe is "adequate but disconnected."Icons: Use muted gray/red Lucide icons (e.g., XCircle, CloudOff).The "Synapse" Panel (Right - "Local Unified Intelligence"):Visuals: Brighter glassmorphism (bg-zinc-900/70 backdrop-blur-lg).Accent Glow: A subtle, pulsing gradient border or inner shadow reflecting our hardware colors (Emerald/Purple mix) to signify active intelligence.Icons: Use vibrant accent-colored Lucide icons (e.g., CheckCircle2 in Emerald).Animations: As the user scrolls into this section, the two panels should slide in slightly using Framer Motion. The Synapse panel should have a slight "levitation" effect to feel more premium.3. Content Strategy (Comparison Data Points)We need to compare across four key axes relevant to the Synapse backend architecture:Feature AxisExisting Cloud Solutions (ChatGPT/Claude)Traditional OS Search (Spotlight/Windows)The Synapse WayData PrivacySends private context to public cloud servers.Local, but shallow.Zero-Knowledge Local RAG. Data never leaves the device.Context DepthExcellent reasoning, but disconnected from local files.Finds filenames, doesn't understand content "meaning."Full Semantic Memory. Understands local PDFs, code, and docs.Latency & SpeedDependent on internet connection & server load.Fast for simple queries.Hardware Accelerated. Instant response via local NPU/GPU.OS ActionPassive Chatbot. Cannot control your computer.Can open apps, but cannot execute complex workflows.Active Orchestrator. Switches modes, manages windows & tools.4. Component ArchitectureA. The Section Container (components/Landing/ComparisonSection.tsx)Function: The outer <section> wrapper with appropriate padding (py-24).Header: A centered title block:H2: "The Cost of Fragmented Context."Subtext: "Stop pasting private data into cloud chat windows. Start owning your intelligence."B. The Two-Column Grid (components/Landing/ComparisonGrid.tsx)Layout: A CSS Grid that is 1 column on mobile, 2 columns on desktop (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8).Content: Contains the two main panel definitions.C. The Reusable Comparison Row (components/Landing/ComparisonFeatureRow.tsx)Why: To keep the code clean, we won't hardcode every row. We'll make a reusable component.Props: title, competitorDescription, synapseDescription, categoryIcon.Visuals: A flex row where the left side contains the "bad" description with an 'X' icon, a central label, and the right side contains the "good" description with a Check icon.5. Antigravity Agent Execution Plan (Tasks)Agent Instructions: Execute these tasks sequentially to build the Comparison Section.Task 1: Scaffold the Section & HeaderCreate components/Landing/ComparisonSection.tsx.Add the dark background, vertical padding, and the main centered typography header using Tailwind utility classes matching the project's design system.Task 2: Build the "Feature Row" ComponentCreate components/Landing/ComparisonFeatureRow.tsx.Import necessary icons from lucide-react (CheckCircle2, XCircle, Shield, Cpu, BrainCircuit, Layers).Design the row layout: Left Icon + Muted Text | Central bold Title label | Right Colored Icon + Bright Text.Task 3: Assemble the Grid PanelsCreate the main structure in ComparisonSection.tsx.Define the two large glassmorphic column containers (Left: Dimmer/Gray, Right: Brighter/Accent Glow). Add sticky headers to these columns ("Existing Solutions" vs. "Synapse Core").Task 4: Populate DataInside the grid columns, stack four instances of the ComparisonFeatureRow component.Use the data points listed in Section 3 (Privacy, Context Depth, Latency, OS Action) to populate the props for each row.Task 5: Add Entrance AnimationsWrap the two main column containers with Framer Motion's <motion.div>.Apply a simple scroll-triggered animation: initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }} whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }} with a slight delay on the Synapse column to make it pop second.Task 6: Integrate into Landing PageImport ComparisonSection into app/page.tsx and place it in the desired scroll order.
