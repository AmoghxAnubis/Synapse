## 2024-05-15 - [CustomCursor Animation Optimization]
**Learning:** The CustomCursor component in `frontend/components/CustomCursor.tsx` was running a continuous `requestAnimationFrame` loop that modified DOM styles directly every frame, even when the mouse was completely stationary. This caused unnecessary main-thread overhead.
**Action:** Introduced an early-return check inside the `requestAnimationFrame` loop to skip DOM updates when the mouse hasn't moved and its hover state hasn't changed. Added `{ passive: true }` to mouse event listeners to improve scroll performance. Always look for ways to pause animation loops when the target element is idle.
